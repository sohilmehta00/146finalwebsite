<p>The NotYelp! team is an exceptional group of people, who met at Stevens Institute of Technology. This project was initially for a group project that the team members had to complete for a class final. However, despite this being a project that needed to be completed, this website might prove useful for the residents of hoboken and even Stevens Students!</p>
        
        
    <p>The team has provided real life reviews from real life costumers. This allows us to get detailed information on how the public enjoys certain food places around hoboken. Rest assured that the team will always keep you in the loop about food places in real time!</p>
